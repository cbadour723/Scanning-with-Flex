Write the scanner for a desk calculator that recognizes:

(40 points) Integers - these can be written in octal (any integer that starts with 0), decimal, or hexadecimal (any integer that starts with 0x). The output for these should be INT.
(40 points) Floating point values - these can be written with or without leading 0s (for example, 0.12 or .12), as well as in scientific notation (1.234568e+5 instead of 123456.789). The output for these should be FLOAT.
(10 points) Algebraic operators: +, -, /, *, %, and =. The output for these should be, ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE, MULTIPLY, MODULO, and EQUAL, respectively.
(10 points) Six letters that can be used as variables: a, b, c, d, e, and f. The output for these should be ID.
(10 points) Open and close parentheses: ( and ). The output for these should be OP and CP, respectively.
Submit your scanner.l file that contains your solution. Due: Sunday, November 12 at 11:59 PM. You may use one or more of your three late days
